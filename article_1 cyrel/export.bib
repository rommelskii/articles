   abstract = {In recent years, educational resources have gradually been digitized, and digital education platforms have gradually become popular. We use AI to accurately assist people in performing daily tasks through a machine learning process. In education, we can use AI in many situations, such as predicting student's learning outcome and discovering student's learning strategies. However, most solutions have not yet utilized modern AI capabilities, such as natural language processing. This research aims to help teachers use machines to automatically generate short answer questions to reduce the time for teachers to write exam questions. In addition, the main reason we focus on short answers is that many studies prove that short answer exercises can enhance student's long-term memory, thereby improving their learning performance. We propose an automatic question generation (AQG) system that combines syntax-base and semantics-base, in order to prove that the system is highly available and improve student's learning performance, we conducted experiments with 41 students. The experimental results show that student's learning performance has been significantly improved, which means that by repeatedly testing the machine question generation system, students can deepen their long-term memory of course knowledge.},

   abstract = {Text recognition is a long-standing research problem for document digitalization. Existing approaches are usually built based on CNN for image understanding and RNN for char-level text generation. In addition, another language model is usually needed to improve the overall accuracy as a post-processing step. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end text recognition approach with pre-trained image Transformer and text Transformer models, namely TrOCR, which leverages the Transformer architecture for both image understanding and wordpiece-level text generation. The TrOCR model is simple but effective, and can be pre-trained with large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned with human-labeled datasets. Experiments show that the TrOCR model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on the printed, handwritten and scene text recognition tasks. The TrOCR models and code are publicly available at \url\{https://aka.ms/trocr\}.},

We developed the automatic question-Answer pairs generation system for patient education, which can be converted into question-Answer pairs in matching video content according to different patient education videos. These question-Answer pairs can fully help patients understand pre-And post-operative patient education, by collecting a large number of existing patient education videos in the hospital. The retrieval-based question answering system can query the questions and answers database established by the question-Answer pair generation system. The system we propose is mainly divided into three parts. The first part is the text generation (TG) module, which processes the video into text and provides the data required by the subsequent modules. The second part is the answer extraction (AE) module, which aims to extract entities and nouns in the text as candidate answers. The third part is a BART-based question generation (QG) module, which generates corresponding questions by inputting sentences including answers.},

One of the applications, widely explored by researchers is generating questions automatically from the text. Ample amount of research work is available with respect to automatic generation of questions for framing the question paper. However, framing the question paper is a teacher centric application. Automatic question generation can also be used for enhancing the student learning. Majority of the computer science papers include practical component and students need to appear for practical exam which encompass viva. In this paper, we have proposed a method to generate the questions automatically from the programming code for three different languages, C++, Java and Python. The proposed method is implemented as part of a web tool ViQG (Viva Question Generator). The web tool can aid students to prepare for the viva by generating the probable questions related to a specific piece of code. This can reduce the time and effort required to explore the questions related to certain code, on different platforms.},

Fundamentally, most QA systems combined several techniques from other fields such as information retrieval, knowledge representation, and natural language processing to process NLQ and present the most insightful response based on the stored document.

   abstract = {Deep learning has attained many remarkable advancements over the past few years and is now rapidly developing in the NLP field. Abstractive automatic text summarization indicates the process of employing computer software that summarizes a document without altering the actual intent of the content. Several use cases for automatic summarization include creating headlines, summarizing scientific documents, segmenting search results, and summarizing product reviews. In the period of the Information explosion, large amounts of data, and the Internet, the ability to express the core meaning of information concisely will help address the information overload crisis. Traditional Techniques often relied on extractive summarization, which involves selecting and rearranging existing sentences or phrases from the source text to create a summary that may lack coherence and fail to generate novel sentences. Deciding what information to include or exclude and how to compress the content without losing important details is challenging. In this research, a BART-based model is used (a denoising autoencoder for pre-training inter-sequence models) to develop a data set trained for automatic analysis and summarization of long texts and articles. The model is pre-trained in English. Additionally, it uses a model based on the trained dataset to answer questions from the text. Our approach is based on textual answers provided by the community, making it easier to implement and answer more complex questions. The proposed schema explores various techniques such as question-and-answer classification and query generation. Finally, the test results are attached and evaluated.},

In this study, we are interested in settings, where for a language under investigation, no training data is available. More specifically, we explore whether pretrained multilingual language models can be employed for zero-shot cross-lingual keyword extraction on low-resource languages with limited or no available labeled training data and whether they outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised keyword extractors. The comparison is conducted on six news article datasets covering two high-resource languages, English and Russian, and four low-resource languages, Croatian, Estonian, Latvian, and Slovenian. We find that the pretrained models fine-tuned on a multilingual corpus covering languages that do not appear in the test set (i.e. in a zero-shot setting), consistently outscore unsupervised models in all six languages.},
