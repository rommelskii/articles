   abstract = {According to the Philippine National Standards (PNS), mature jackfruit are defined by their spines being separated far apart and well-developed. Such maturity feature is present in many local cultivars in the Philippines, specifically within the Magnolia jackfruit variety. We developed a maturity classification system based on the Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP) operator as the texture descriptor and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification model. Initially, the Region of Interest (ROI) was extracted from the captured image to emphasize the jackfruit's rind. Then, the ULBP operator was used to detect and capture local texture patterns exhibited by the spines. The Hue histogram was also extracted to incorporate the rind's discoloration. Finally, the extracted features were concatenated to generate the final feature vector. A total of 240 images were utilized to train the system for jackfruit maturity classification. The proposed methodology yielded an accuracy of 93.33% for Magnolia's immature and mature classes.},

   abstract = {Manual checking of test papers is still one of the most tedious tasks of being an educator. The immediate feedback of these exam results from the teachers enhances the student's learning experience since it also enables the teachers to identify the knowledge gap in the class efficiently. Thus, this study is mainly designed to develop an intelligent bubble-sheet test checker with a scoring system employing computer vision for automated checking using Python. This system requires the examiner to input the student's name and ID number into the system using the touchscreen monitor, then place the bubble sheet properly inside the chamber. The camera button must be pressed to capture the bubble sheet's image and undergo image processing; after a few seconds, the student's score is displayed. Canny edge detection, image segmentation, and inverse warp perspective are some of the image processing techniques involved in this study. To examine the system's accuracy, confusion matrix analysis and paired t-test are used. The confusion matrix analysis assesses the device's correctness in checking each letter on the shaded bubble sheet, which revealed a high accuracy rate of 96.80%. On the other hand, the paired t-test evaluates the accuracy of automated checking versus manual checking, which resulted in a p-value of 0.01.},

We use AI to accurately assist people in performing daily tasks through a machine learning process. In education, we can use AI in many situations, such as predicting student's learning outcome and discovering student's learning strategies. However, most solutions have not yet utilized modern AI capabilities, such as natural language processing. This research aims to help teachers use machines to automatically generate short answer questions to reduce the time for teachers to write exam questions. In addition, the main reason we focus on short answers is that many studies prove that short answer exercises can enhance student's long-term memory, thereby improving their learning performance. We propose an automatic question generation (AQG) system that combines syntax-base and semantics-base, in order to prove that the system is highly available and improve student's learning performance, we conducted experiments with 41 students. The experimental results show that student's learning performance has been significantly improved, which means that by repeatedly testing the machine question generation system, students can deepen their long-term memory of course knowledge.},

This paper proposed a Linguistic Quality and Semantic Similarity Model (LQSSM) to evaluate generated summaries more comprehensively. Considering the readability of summaries, a linguistic quality evaluation network (LQEN) is proposed to evaluate summaries automatically. Meanwhile, a semantic similarity evaluation network (SSEN) is introduced to directly measure the informativeness between the summary and original . Additionally, there is also a comprehensive evaluation using fusion indicators. The LQSSM and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) methods were used to score the summaries generated by five models. The results showed that the proposed method gave further feedback from different angles on the basis of reaching the level of other methods.},

The K-BERT model uses a knowledge graph to perform transfer learning on the pre-trained BERT model. However, the K-BERT model adds the knowledge that exists in the knowledge graph rather than the data relevant to the topic of the input data when using the knowledge graph of the corresponding field. Hence, the K-BERT model can cause confusion in the training. To solve this problem, this study proposes a topic-based knowledge graph BERT (TK-BERT) model, which uses the topic modeling technique. The TK-BERT model divides the knowledge graph by topic using the knowledge graph's topic model and infers the topic for the input sentence, adding only knowledge relevant to the topic. Therefore, the TK-BERT model does not add unnecessary knowledge to the knowledge graph. Moreover, the proposed TK-BERT model outperforms the K-BERT model.},

Although there is easy access to resources from the web, learning only becomes complete after a thorough system of assessment to identify gaps in the learning process if any. Automatic question generation techniques have been introduced to reduce the time associated with the manual construction of questions. Researchers have come up with stateof-art models to generate these questions. Models like BERT and GPT gained popularity among the masses due to their deduction of complex sentences. These have however been replaced with advanced models such as Transformers which are much more versatile. This paper has fine-tuned one such transformer and proposed a custom model to generate questions. Our system mainly focuses on two types of questions, namely multiple-choice, and long answer types. The generator model is primarily concerned with producing questions from selected phrases and generating semantically motivated phrase-level distractors as MCQ response choices. In contrast, the evaluator model is concerned with identifying the most relevant question-answer combinations. This research work has gained the ability to acquire 76% syntactic accuracy and 84% fluency from the question-answer pairs evaluated using our approach. Along with this, the proposed result has achieved a final accuracy of 82% from the evaluator's bert-base-cased model.},

Being provided by unreliable sources, some news can be misleading. In fact, the assessment of the correctness of the news can be region related. In other words, news can be true in a specific region while fake in another. Existing proposed solutions for fake news detection developed in centralized platforms are not considering the location from where the news gets announced, but they are focused more on the news content. In this paper, a region-based distributed fake news detection framework is proposed. The framework is deployed in a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) environment where a set of workers responsible for collecting news are selected based on their availability in a specific region. The selected workers share the news to the nearest edge node, where the pre-processing and detection of fake news are executed locally. The detection process uses a pre-trained BERT model where it achieved an accuracy of 91 %.},

One of the most common problems is determining fruit ripeness purely by visual inspection and traditional methods, such as relying on touch, which is challenging to implement. The Color Segmentation Algorithm used in the study operates in the HSV color space. The Canny Edge detection technique utilizes a region-growing approach, region merging, and initial seed selection. Following the segmentation process, the ripeness of the Cantaloupe is determined using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm based on its features, where accuracy reports from the dataset determine the best value of K. The proposed Color Segmentation Algorithm successfully segments the captured Cantaloupe images without any errors and determines their ripeness in most cases based on the KNN Algorithm. However, there are instances where the KNN algorithm incorrectly predicts ripeness from uneven lighting and objects detected in the image, resulting in an accuracy of 80 percent. In general, the system's accuracy based on the Confusion Matrix testing dataset is 95 percent, and as for actual testing, it's 80 percent, as stated before.},

This research develops a Support Vector Machine (SVM) system that recognizes and converts Baybayin words into their respective Tagalog representation. The linear and RBF kernels enhanced character prediction, improving accuracy and robustness. An overall accuracy score of 96.88% was obtained for the RBF kernel on the more straightforward Baybayin characters and 93.59% for the Linear Kernel on the more complex Baybayin characters. The processed images are classified into central character bodies and accent signs; the characters are predicted and combined before changing into their respective character equivalents from the accents. Characters are recombined after accent modifications to form the predicted Baybayin word. Testing on a dataset of 120 sample words of varying words written in Baybayin achieved 90.83% accuracy in word recognition. This indicates SVM's capability to distinguish the intricate strokes and variations of the Baybayin script.

   abstract = {In the Philippines, Baybayin is one of its writing systems that originated in pre-Hispanic colonialism. The centuries-old writing system gained attention and popularity, which later turned into an approved bill in 2018. The recent development of research aimed at translating Baybayin characters into Alphabets, the globally recognizable writing system, uses Artificial Intelligence or A.I. Different researchers have developed an optical character recognition system for the Baybayin script but are incapable of translating multiple characters in single image and are all using object classification algorithms. Therefore, there is a need for a system using a YOLOv3 based CNN architecture capable of recognizing Baybayin scripts in word form. Using the YOLOv3 algorithm, the system was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.92%. It was observed that some of the misclassifications are due to distorted or illegible handwriting. It can be concluded that the optical character recognition of Baybayin characters using the YOLOv3 algorithm is of high accuracy when it comes to detecting and classifying Baybayin characters.},

   abstract = {Keyword extraction is the task of retrieving words that are essential to the content of a given document. Researchers proposed various approaches to tackle this problem. At the top-most level, approaches are divided into ones that require training - supervised and ones that do not - unsupervised. In this study, we are interested in settings, where for a language under investigation, no training data is available. More specifically, we explore whether pretrained multilingual language models can be employed for zero-shot cross-lingual keyword extraction on low-resource languages with limited or no available labeled training data and whether they outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised keyword extractors. The comparison is conducted on six news article datasets covering two high-resource languages, English and Russian, and four low-resource languages, Croatian, Estonian, Latvian, and Slovenian. We find that the pretrained models fine-tuned on a multilingual corpus covering languages that do not appear in the test set (i.e. in a zero-shot setting), consistently outscore unsupervised models in all six languages.},

   abstract = {Key phrase extraction is a fundamental task in information management, which is often used as a preliminary step in various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks. Embedding models achieve higher F-scores than graph-based models in key phrase extraction for short documents compared to longer documents. Therefore, they are suitable for real-time semantic processing of short textual data. With a vast set of embedding models dedicated to key phrase extraction, it becomes a tedious task to overview and compare the performance of each model. Hence, we have carried out an extensive comparative study of four prominent pre-trained embedding models, namely Sentence Transformers, Flair, spaCy, and Universal Sentence Encoder, that have been used in conjunction with Key-BERT. The results of the experiments conducted on this corpus show that the Sentence Transformer "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" version outperforms the other embedding models listed above, with respect to BERT score evaluation and adaptability to transfer learning. Notably, spaCy exhibits fast processing while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. An extensive comparison of Key-BERT-based embedding models suited to texts of different sizes and a detailed qualitative analysis makes the case for our proposed methodology.},

   abstract = {Deep learning has attained many remarkable advancements over the past few years and is now rapidly developing in the NLP field. Abstractive automatic text summarization indicates the process of employing computer software that summarizes a document without altering the actual intent of the content. Several use cases for automatic summarization include creating headlines, summarizing scientific documents, segmenting search results, and summarizing product reviews. In the period of the Information explosion, large amounts of data, and the Internet, the ability to express the core meaning of information concisely will help address the information overload crisis. Traditional Techniques often relied on extractive summarization, which involves selecting and rearranging existing sentences or phrases from the source text to create a summary that may lack coherence and fail to generate novel sentences. Deciding what information to include or exclude and how to compress the content without losing important details is challenging. In this research, a BART-based model is used (a denoising autoencoder for pre-training inter-sequence models) to develop a data set trained for automatic analysis and summarization of long texts and articles. The model is pre-trained in English. Additionally, it uses a model based on the trained dataset to answer questions from the text. Our approach is based on textual answers provided by the community, making it easier to implement and answer more complex questions. The proposed schema explores various techniques such as question-and-answer classification and query generation. Finally, the test results are attached and evaluated.},

   abstract = {KeyBERT is a method for keywords/keyphrases extraction, which has three steps. The first step is selecting candidate keywords from a text using sklearn library, the second step is the embedding operation of the text and its candidate keywords; this operation is done by BERT to get a numerical representation that represents the meanings. The third step is calculating the cosine similarity between individual keywords vectors and document vector. In this paper, we focus on the second step of KeyBERT (embedding step). Although KeyBERT has a lot of supported models for the embedding operation, there are no extensive previous comparative studies to analyze and study the effect of using different supported models in KeyBERT. We introduce a comparative study of two commonly used groups of models; the first group is sentence-transformers pretrained models, supported via the sentence-transformers library, and the second group includes the Longformer model, supported via the Hugginface Transformers library. We conduct the comparative study of models on benchmark datasets, which contain English text documents of multi-domains with different text lengths. Based on the study, we found that the Paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2 model provides the best results among all other models in keyword extraction in terms of effectiveness (f1-score, recall, precision, MAP) on all datasets, with higher efficiency (time) on short text compared with using it on long text; accordingly, we recommend using it in that context. On the other hand, the Longformer model is the most efficient/fastest in keyword extraction among all other models on all datasets and this superiority has been evident, especially in long text; accordingly, we recommend using it in that context.},

   abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

The efficacy of CNNs has been established in research, particularly in agricultural automation. The researchers in this study assessed the performance of two CNN architectures - MobileNetv2 and VGG-16 - in predicting six medicinal mushrooms - Lions Mane, Oyster, Reishi, Shiitake, Shimeji, and Volva. The aim was to compare the accuracy levels achieved by each architecture. A dataset comprising of 600 image samples of six medicinal mushrooms was employed to train the two architectures, with both training procedures employing an 80 by 20 ratio. 80 percent of the total data was utilized to train the models, while the remaining 20 percent was reserved for the validation set. The results show that MobileNetv2 yielded a testing accuracy rate of 97.3 percent while the VGG-16 achieved testing accuracy of 72.6 percent. This implies that accuracy in predicting medicinal mushroom using MobileNetv2 is higher than VGG-16 by 24.7 percent. Hence, using MobileNetv2 architecture will provide optimal results over VGG-16 in identifying medicinal mushrooms. For future studies, the researchers aim to train these medicinal mushrooms dataset in a continual learning scenario and evaluate the extent of catastrophic forgetting.},

BERT combined with convolutional neural network is proposed to extend the BERT-CNN model for the problem of lack of semantic knowledge of BERT to derive a good classification effect. The second RoBERTa model performs feature extraction and fusion to obtain the feature word vector as the text output vector, which can solve the problem of insufficient BERT extracted features. The BERT-BiGRU model, on the other hand, mainly avoids the increase in the number of texts leading to long training time and overfitting, and uses a simpler GRU bi-word network as the main network to fully extract the contextual information of Chinese texts and finally complete the classification of Chinese texts; at the same time, it makes an outlook and conclusion on the new pre-training model for Chinese TC.},
